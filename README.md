# ClinicProX (MySQL Version)

This project is a **Full Stack Web Application** built with **ReactJS** (frontend) and **ExpressJS + MySQL** (backend).  
It is an upgraded version of my earlier project **ClinicProX**, where the database was **MongoDB**.  
In this version, I replaced **MongoDB** with **MySQL** to work with a relational database structure.
